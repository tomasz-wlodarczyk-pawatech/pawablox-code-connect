# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to add a changeset

When you make a change to the codebase that affects the public API or behavior of any package:

```bash
bun changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the type of version bump (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset file will be created in this folder and should be committed with your PR.

## Releasing

When changesets are merged to `main`, the GitHub Action will:
1. Create a "Version Packages" PR that bumps versions and updates changelogs
2. When that PR is merged, packages are automatically published to GitHub Packages
